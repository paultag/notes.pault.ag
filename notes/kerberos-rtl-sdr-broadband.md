Over the last year, I've been spending all of my (limited) free time learning
how <abbr title="Radio Frequency">RF</abbr> devices work, and specifically,
how <abbr title="Software Defined Radios">SDRs</abbr> work. This lead me to
get an amateur radio license, and made a few new friends in the area too.

It's been incredibly humbling to set aside the subject areas I've worked
so many years to master, venturing into communities where I am once again
the novice in the room. Pushing myself has been a massive amount of work,
and work that causes me to question basic things about myself -- such as my
competence or capability as an engineer -- but it's been some of the most
rewarding in recent memory as I work through each hurdle.

It's about as good of a time as any to take a step back, and to write about
some of the things I've learned.
